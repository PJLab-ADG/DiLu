I have 4 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. The distance between me and car `400` is 810.86 - 766.79 = 44.07 m, and the difference in speed is 19.90 - 23.86 = -3.96 m/s. Car `400` is traveling 44.07 m ahead of me and its speed is 3.96 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car behind me on the current lane, which is car `872`. The distance between me and car `872` is 766.79 - 737.22 = 29.57 m, and the difference in speed is 23.86 - 15.78 = 8.08 m/s. Car `872` is traveling 29.57 m behind me and its speed is 8.08 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the rear car on the current lane. So I can idle.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: IDLE
