I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 661.16 - 639.93 = 21.23 m, and the difference in speed is 16.29 - 16.02 = 0.27 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 21.23 m ahead of me and its speed is 0.27 m/s faster than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already at the desired level, so I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can maintain my current speed. I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. Due to above calculation, the distance between me and car `208` is 21.23 m, and the difference in speed is 0.27 m/s. The distance 21.23 m is smaller than my preferred car following distance 30 m, and my speed is already at the desired level. So I can maintain my current speed.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: IDLE
