I have 4 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. The distance between me and car `400` is 850.73 - 814.71 = 36.02 m, and the difference in speed is 19.97 - 24.00 = -4.03 m/s. Car `400` is traveling 36.02 m ahead of me and its speed is 4.03 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. Due to the above calculation, the distance between me and car `400` is 36.02 m, and the difference in speed is -4.03 m/s. The distance 36.02 m is lower than my preferred car following distance 30 m, and my speed is higher than the front car on the current lane. If I choose idle, the distance between me and car `400` will be further smaller, so I should not idle.
- Now, I want to see if I can change lanes to the left. The car in front of me on the left lane is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 815.73 - 814.71 = 1.02 m, and the difference in speed is 18.16 - 24.00 = -5.84 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 1.02 m ahead of me and its speed is 5.84 m/s slower than mine. This distance is too close and my speed is too high, so I should not change lanes to the left.
- Since I cannot accelerate, idle, or change lanes, the only option left is to decelerate to maintain a safe distance from the car in front of me.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: Deceleration
