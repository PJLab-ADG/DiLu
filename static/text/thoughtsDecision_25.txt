I have 4 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. The distance between me and car `400` is 830.78 - 790.73 = 40.05 m, and the difference in speed is 19.93 - 23.98 = -4.05 m/s. Car `400` is traveling 40.05 m ahead of me and its speed is 4.05 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can maintain my current speed. I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. Due to above calculation, the distance between me and car `400` is 40.05 m, and the difference in speed is -4.05 m/s. The distance 40.05 m is larger than my preferred car following distance 30 m, and my speed is higher than the front car on the current lane. So I can maintain my current speed.
Great, I can make my decision now.
Final Answer: IDLE
