I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 451.30 - 411.54 = 39.76 m, and the difference in speed is 15.12 - 23.34 = -8.22 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 39.76 m ahead of me and its speed is 8.22 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. Due to above calculation, the distance between me and car `208` is 39.76 m, and the difference in speed is -8.22 m/s. The distance 39.76 m is higher than my preferred car following distance 30 m, and my speed is higher than the front car on the current lane. So I can idle.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: Idle
