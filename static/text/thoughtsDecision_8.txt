I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 515.18 - 505.13 = 10.05 m, and the difference in speed is 16.42 - 20.68 = -4.26 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 10.05 m ahead of me and its speed is 4.26 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can maintain my current speed. I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. Due to above calculation, the distance between me and car `208` is 10.05 m, and the difference in speed is -4.26 m/s. The distance 10.05 m is lower than my preferred car following distance 30 m, and my speed is higher than the front car on the current lane. If I choose idle, the distance between me and car `208` will be further smaller, so I should not idle.
- In order to keep a preferred distance with the front car, I can only decelerate. Deceleration is a feasible action.
Great, I can make my decision now.
Final Answer: Deceleration
