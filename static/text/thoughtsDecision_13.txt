I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 596.63 - 572.41 = 24.22 m, and the difference in speed is 16.10 - 15.22 = 0.88 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 24.22 m ahead of me and its speed is 0.88 m/s faster than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already lower than the front car on the current lane. So I can accelerate.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: Acceleration
