I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 482.58 - 459.15 = 23.43 m, and the difference in speed is 16.09 - 23.98 = -7.89 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 23.43 m ahead of me and its speed is 7.89 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car behind me on the current lane, which is car `152`. The distance between me and car `152` is 459.15 - 449.62 = 9.53 m, and the difference in speed is 23.98 - 5.88 = 18.10 m/s. Car `152` is traveling 9.53 m behind me and its speed is 18.10 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the rear car on the current lane. So I can idle.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: IDLE
