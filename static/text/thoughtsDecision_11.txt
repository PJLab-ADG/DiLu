I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 564.30 - 548.25 = 16.05 m, and the difference in speed is 16.25 - 8.82 = 7.43 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 16.05 m ahead of me and its speed is 7.43 m/s faster than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already lower than the front car on the current lane. So I can accelerate.
Great, I can make my decision now.
Final Answer: Acceleration
