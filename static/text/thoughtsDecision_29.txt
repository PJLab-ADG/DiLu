I have 4 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. The distance between me and car `400` is 910.82 - 877.10 = 33.72 m, and the difference in speed is 20.10 - 20.02 = 0.08 m/s. Car `400` is traveling 33.72 m ahead of me and its speed is slightly faster than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already at the desired level, so I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. Due to the above calculation, the distance between me and car `400` is 33.72 m, and the difference in speed is 0.08 m/s. The distance 33.72 m is safe and my speed is already at the desired level. So I can maintain my current speed.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: IDLE
