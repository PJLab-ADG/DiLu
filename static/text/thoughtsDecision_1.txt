I have 5 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `208`. The distance between me and car `208` is 405.55 - 347.05 = 58.50 m, and the difference in speed is 19.00 - 24.17 = -5.17 m/s. Car `208` is traveling 58.50 m ahead of me and its speed is 5.17 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car behind me on the current lane, which is car `848`. The distance between me and car `848` is 347.05 - 365.49 = -18.44 m, and the difference in speed is 24.17 - 19.38 = 4.79 m/s. Car `848` is traveling 18.44 m behind me and its speed is 4.79 m/s slower than mine. This distance is too close and my speed is already higher than the rear car on the current lane. If I idle, the distance between me and car `848` will be further smaller, so I should not idle.
- In order to keep a safe distance with the rear car, I can only decelerate. Deceleration is a feasible action.
Great, I can make my decision now.
Final Answer: Deceleration
