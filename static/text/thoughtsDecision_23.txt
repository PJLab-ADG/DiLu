I have 4 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. The distance between me and car `400` is 790.97 - 743.19 = 47.78 m, and the difference in speed is 19.88 - 23.20 = -3.32 m/s. Car `400` is traveling 47.78 m ahead of me and its speed is 3.32 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the front car on the current lane. So I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car behind me on the current lane, which is car `872`. The distance between me and car `872` is 743.19 - 722.03 = 21.16 m, and the difference in speed is 23.20 - 14.62 = 8.58 m/s. Car `872` is traveling 21.16 m behind me and its speed is 8.58 m/s slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already higher than the rear car on the current lane. So idling is a feasible action.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: IDLE
