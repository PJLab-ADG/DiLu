I have 4 actions to choose from. Now, I would like to know which action is possible.
I should first check if I can accelerate, then idle, finally decelerate. I can also try to change lanes but with caution and not too frequently.

- I want to know if I can accelerate, so I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. The distance between me and car `400` is 890.74 - 857.04 = 33.70 m, and the difference in speed is 20.05 - 20.12 = -0.07 m/s. Car `400` is traveling 33.70 m ahead of me and its speed is slightly slower than mine. This distance is safe and my speed is already at the desired level, so I should not accelerate.
- Since I cannot accelerate, I want to know if I can idle. I need to observe the car in front of me on the current lane, which is car `400`. Due to above calculation, the distance between me and car `400` is 33.70 m, and the difference in speed is -0.07 m/s. The distance 33.70 m is larger than my preferred car following distance 30 m, and my speed is not higher than the front car on the current lane. So I can idle.
Great, I can make my decision now. Decision: IDLE
