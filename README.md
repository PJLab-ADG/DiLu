> DiLu is an innovative **closed-loop** and **self-evolving** framework for autonomous driving that integrates common-sense knowledge and memory components, empowered by large language models.

## 🌟Highlights

- **`2023-10-12`** Our project page is now online, [Check it out here](https://pjlab-adg.github.io/DiLu)🔗!
- **`2023-09-28`** Our paper is available on [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16292)📄!

## 🚀Knowledge-Driven Autonomous Driving

<div>
We suggest the next-generation knowledge-driven paradigm for autonomous driving systems includes three components:
<ol>
<li>An <a style="color:darkgreen">environment</a> with which an agent can interact;
</li>
<li>A <a style="color:#FF6F61">driver agent</a> with recall, reasoning, and reflection abilities;
</li>
<li>A <a style="color:#2F80ED">memory component</a> to persist experiences;
</li>
</ol>
In continuous evolution, the driver agent observes the environment, queries, and updates experiences from the
memory component and performs decision-making.

## 🔍Framework Overview

![Framework Overview](./assets/framework.png)

Based on the knowledge-driven paradigm for autonomous driving systems introduced above, we propose a practical
framework called DiLu, which consists of four core modules: <b>Environment, Reasoning, Reflection, and Memory</b>.
