TOOLS:

You have access to the following tools:

FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS = """The way you use the tools is by specifying a json blob.
Specifically, this json should have a `action` key (with the name of the tool to use) and a `action_input` key (with the input to the tool going here).
The only values that should be in the "action" field are one of: {tool_names}

The $JSON_BLOB should only contain a SINGLE action, do NOT return a list of multiple actions. Here is an example of a valid $JSON_BLOB:
```
{{{{
  "action": $TOOL_NAME,
  "action_input": $INPUT
}}}}
```

ALWAYS use the following format when you use tool:
Question: the input question you must answer
Thought: always summarize the tools you have used and think what to do next step by step
Action:
```
$JSON_BLOB
```
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Observation can repeat N times)

When you have a final answer, you MUST use the format:
Thought: I now know the final answer, then summary why you have this answer
Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question"""

The driving task usually invovles many steps. You can break this task down into subtasks and complete them one by one.

Donot use multiple tools at one time.
